Task

1. Let's execute multiple coroutines at the same time with async

Import wait_random from the previous python file that youâ€™ve written and write
an async routine called wait_n that takes in 2 int arguments (in this order): n
and max_delay. You will spawn wait_random n times with the specified max_delay.

wait_n should return the list of all the delays (float values). The list of the
delays should be in ascending order without using sort() because of concurrency
